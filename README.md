# Round-efficient oblivious shuffling
## Source
The implementation is created from the paper [Laur, S., Willemson, J., and Zhang, B. "Round-efficient Oblivious Database Manipulation"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-24861-0_18).

**This is not** an official implementation of this paper

## Motivation
The implementation has been done to be used together with the oblivious sorting algorithm by [Hamda et al. (2012)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-37682-5_15), in the context of a Research Project on [Privacy Preserving Cohort Selection (PPCS)](https://github.com/A-GX/Privacy-Preserving-Cohort-Selection).
